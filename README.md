This project is a first attempt at simple screen scraping challenge.
The code will go over the stocks in the TA-100 index (100 largest companies in Tel-Aviv stock exchange). for each stock, it will rip the current price from the stock-specific URL and add it to an SQL server (postgreSQL is used in this project but any SQL server that holds the same name tables and DBs will do).

The rip is done on the israel Bizportal domain and is only for educatinoal purposes and should be used since it can cause a DOS on the domain.
